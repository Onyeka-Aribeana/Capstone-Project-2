## My process
It was a step by step process from each of us on this project. First we divided the project into sections for group members and then started working on each part ourselves.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Tailwind CSS

### What I learned
1). How to make images properly fit in div with object-cover, h-full and w-full
2). How to hide cerain HTML elements at mobile screen widths for the navbar.
3). How to include Background-images, font-families, and custom colors to the tailwind config file.
4). How to properly upload a project worked with TailwindCSS.
5). Howw to use percentages for widths to that certain HTML elements remain the same width in certain screen sizes.
6). Understood more about flexbox and grid and how they both work.

### Continued development

For continued development, we have to figure out when to implement flexbox and how to makes use of TailwindCSS in an optimized fashion
